# Wireframing
**Wireframing** is the process of creating a **simple visual guide** that represents the layout and structure of a web page or app screen.It is a **blueprint** for your design, it shows where things go, but without the final colors, images, or styling.
## Importance of wireframes in design process
- plan the layout before building the actual product
- Focus on functionality and user flow (not the visuals yet).
- Communicate ideas clearly with teammates or stakeholders.
- Save time by spotting issues early.
