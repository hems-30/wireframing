# Wireframing
**Wireframing** is the process of creating a **simple visual guide** that represents the layout and structure of a web page or app screen.It is a **blueprint** for your design, it shows where things go, but without the final colors, images, or styling.
## Importance of wireframes in design process
- plan the layout before building the actual product
- Focus on functionality and user flow (not the visuals yet).
- Communicate ideas clearly with teammates or stakeholders.
- Save time by spotting issues early.
# Key Elements of a Wireframe
Wireframes outline the basic structure and functionality of a web page or app. Below are the key elements:
1. **Layout Structure**: Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.It ensures a clear and consistent layout.
Example: A blog page with a top header, main content area, and sidebar.
2. **Navigation**: Shows how users will move through the site or application.It Helps users find what they need quickly.
Example: A navigation bar with links to Home, About, and Contact.
3. **Content Placement**: Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned. It Focuses user attention on key messages.
Example: A landing page with a headline, supporting text, and call-to-action.
4. **Functionality**: Outlines key functionalities and interactions. It Shows how users will interact with the product.
Example: Login form with input fields, buttons, and password reset link.
 # Types of Wireframes
Wireframes vary in detail and purpose depending on the stage of the design process. The two main types are:

ðŸ”¹ Low-Fidelity Wireframes
These are simple, rough sketches that focus on layout and structure without design details like colors, fonts, or images.
- Used for: Early brainstorming, quick ideas, and team discussions.
- Looks like: Black-and-white boxes, placeholders, and basic text labels.
- Great for rapid prototyping and gathering early feedback.

ðŸ”¸ High-Fidelity Wireframes
These are detailed, polished wireframes that closely resemble the final design in layout, spacing, and sometimes real content.
- Used for: Finalizing UI/UX details, usability testing, and handoff to developers.
- Looks like: Styled components, real images or text, and interactive elements.
- Helps stakeholders and developers understand exactly how the product will look and work.
## Wireframe Type Used Here
The wireframe included in this project is a High-Fidelity Wireframe.
- It features detailed design elements such as actual fonts, images, colors, and spacing that closely resemble the final product.
- This type of wireframe is used in the later stages of the design process to communicate precise UI/UX decisions.
- It allows for usability testing, stakeholder review, and a clear handoff to developers
